This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript's handling of the IsEmpty function when used with empty array arguments. The provided VBScript function `f` attempts to handle empty arguments by defaulting them to 0 using IsEmpty(). However, this does not work as expected with empty arrays and will throw an error. The solution file showcases how to correctly handle such cases using IsArray and UBound to check the data type and structure of the argument.
